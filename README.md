Simplified Financial Management and Easy Loan Approval
Financial Management:
1.	Government Schemes and Policies: Integrate government policies and money-making schemes for user benefit.
2.	AI-Driven Investments: Use AI to recommend investment schemes for 20-30% of user funds to maximize returns.
3.	Custom Spending Limits: Provide the option for default limits or AI-generated limits based on spending habits. For example, if a user spends ₹20,000/month, their limit could be set to 3x or 4x (₹80,000) to prevent fraud.

Easy Loan Approval:

2.	Collateral-Based Loans: Estimate loans at 50% of collateral value.
3.	Adjusted Credit Limits: Lower credit limits for students, new employees, or recent account holders.
4.	Streamlined Identification: Simplify the process with Aadhaar-based eKYC, PAN verification, and biometric security.
